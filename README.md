## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/citrusonya/flights.git
```
## Scripts
Make sure you have Webpack installed.

### Run the app in Hot Reloading mode
```
npm start
```
### Create development build
```
npm run dev
```
### Create production build (with file minification)
```
npm run prod
```
## Important
If Hot Reloading does not work, check ```webpack``` and ```webpack-dev-server``` version. 

In my case, works bundle: ```webpack: 5.23.0``` with ```webpack-dev-server: 4.0.0-beta.0```.
